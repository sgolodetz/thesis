Thesis Corrections Made
#######################

Notes:

* The page numbers in the below refer to pages in the corrected thesis, not the viva thesis.
* As noted below, I assumed that p.187 in Correction 7 was actually intended to refer to p.363 (the conclusion), since we talked about consolidating the contribution lists in the conclusion and the introduction during the viva.

[Correction 1]

p.188 Added a summary of contributions to Chapter 4
p.257 Added a summary of contributions to Chapter 5
p.314 Added a summary of contributions to Chapter 6

[Correction 2]

* Created a new BibTeX style file (in BAFLL) based on 'alpha' to fix the formatting of the references
* Added missing page numbers to references (except where unavailable due to CD-only proceedings)
* Replaced 'visualiz~' with 'visualis~' on a thesis-wide basis.

p.33 Changed the wording from 'known as' to 'that I call' (as explained in the text, other authors use various names for partition forests)
p.33 Added 'under a variety of different names'
p.33 Changed the wording from 'seeing widespread use' to 'being widely used'
p.33 Removed '(and this has been done)' (it has, but there's no obvious reference because it's so trivial)
p.110 Removed 'in order to allow a user to work around potential issues with the initial partition forest construction'
p.112 Changed the order in which the core operations are listed to make it match what is now Figure 4.3
p.138 Explained command managers in a footnote
p.206 Equalised the histograms for Figures 5.11 (c) and (d) to make it easier to distinguish between them
p.218 Fixed a typo (I wrote 'waterfall' where I meant 'watershed')
p.259 Changed 'saw' to 'discussed'
p.319 Added a reference for Dice similarity coefficients
p.417 Added a reference for Dice similarity coefficients

[Correction 3]

p.279 Removed the subjective wordings used for the spine seed criteria
p.281 Added a sentence explaining that the criteria were determined empirically by looking at a number of image series
p.281 Removed the subjective wording used for one of the grow criteria
p.281-2 Improved the justification for the grow criteria
p.288 Removed the subjective wording used for the aspect ratio criterion
p.288 Justified the choice of parameters
p.289 Rewrote the paragraph discussing the criteria to point out that the different criteria are 'weak' by design
p.291 Added a sentence explaining that the specific limit values were chosen empirically by looking at the scans
p.294 Removed the subjective wording used for the voxel count criterion
p.294 Added a justification for the bounding box criterion
p.295 Added a sentence explaining that the value-based criteria had their limits determined empirically
p.295 Mentioned that the removal criterion (< 150) was determined experimentally
p.298-9 Justified the choice of parameters
p.302-3 Justified the choice of parameters
p.307 Removed the subjective wordings used for the kidney criteria
p.307 Justified the choice of parameters
p.311 Justified the choice of parameters

[Correction 4]

p.97 Replaced Table 3.1 with a proper critera-based comparison of the segmentation methods
p.96-7 Updated the list of positive reasons for choosing the watershed/waterfall approach (in particular, removed the claim that snakes doesn't translate as easily to 3D)

[Correction 5]

p.104 Changed the text to reference the new figure
p.107 Added Figure 4.2, an image equivalent of Figure 4.1

[Correction 6]

p.35-6 Reworked the paragraph describing my publications to incorporate my other two peer-reviewed papers

[Correction 7]

p.363-5 Consolidated the contributions on p.363 with those in the introduction (I've assumed that the p.187 in the list was a typo, since we talked about consolidating the introduction and conclusion in the viva - please let me know if that's not the case)

[Correction 8]

[Correction 9]

p.98 Added a paragraph discussing the cost-benefit issues of marker-based methods vs. my method

[Correction 10]

p.261 Added '(as fuzzy sets)'
p.261 Changed the wording to 'As such, the 2D ribs identifier is really a `Bayesian-style' classifier rather than a conventional Bayesian classifier. A proper Bayesian approach involving learning'
p.273 Changed the wording to '`Bayesian-style' classifier based on \emph{fuzzy sets}'
p.274 Changed the wording to 'in place of the probability distribution $\mathbf{P}(\mathit{Area} | \mathit{rib})$ that would be used in a conventional Bayesian classifier'
p.274 Added 'unlike a conventional Bayesian classifier'
