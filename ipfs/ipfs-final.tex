\chapter{Principles of Image Partition Forests}

\section{Chapter Overview}

In Chapter~\ref{chap:methodology}, I discussed the goals of my doctorate and the methods I chose to try to achieve them. This chapter introduces partition forests as a data structure, along with a set of algorithms for working with them. It further explains how the generic partition forest data structure can be applied in the imaging domain. In that context, we will talk of the partition forests as image partition forests (or IPFs). This lays the foundation for the two following chapters, which describe how IPFs can be constructed from images (Chapter~\ref{chap:segmentation}) and then used to identify features therein (Chapter~\ref{chap:featureid}).

As will be discussed in Chapter~\ref{chap:assessment}, however, the partition forest data structure and its accompanying algorithms are useful in a wider context than just imaging. In particular, we will later see another application of partition forests in the domain of hierarchical pathfinding.
