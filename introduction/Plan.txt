- The intertwined fields of segmentation and feature identification pose fundamental challenges in a variety of different domains. One such domain is that of image processing, in which the segmentation problem is first and foremost the task of partitioning an image into regions that correspond to `salient' features therein, although the term is also commonly used to refer to the related task of determining the boundary, or contour, around a feature of interest. The goal of feature identification, by contrast, is to assign semantic meaning to some or all of these regions. Segmentation and feature identification problems TODO
